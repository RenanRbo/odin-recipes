            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Tropeiro beans (feijão tropeiro) is a traditional Brazilian dish, especially popular in the state of Minas Gerais. It's a hearty and flavorful dish that combines beans with ingredients like bacon, sausage, eggs, and manioc flour (farofa). Here's a simple recipe to make it:</p>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 1/2 cups dry pinto beans (or any preferred bean)</li>
                <li>200g (about 7 oz) bacon, diced</li>
                <li>200g (about 7 oz) sausage (preferably calabresa or a similar Brazilian sausage), sliced</li>
                <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
                <li>2 eggs</li>
                <li>1 cup manioc flour (farinha de mandioca)</li>
                <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika (optional)</li>
                <li>1/4 cup chopped green onions or parsley (for garnish)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Prepare the Beans:
                Rinse the beans thoroughly and soak them in water for about 4 hours or overnight.
                After soaking, cook the beans in fresh water until they're tender, about 1 hour. Drain and set aside, reserving a little bit of the cooking liquid.</li>
                <li>Cook the Bacon and Sausage:
                In a large skillet or pan, cook the diced bacon over medium heat until it releases its fat and becomes crispy. Remove the bacon and set aside.
                In the same pan, add the sausage slices and cook until they're browned and crispy. Remove and set aside with the bacon.</li>  
                <li>Make the Base:
                In the same pan, add a little more oil if necessary and sauté the onions and garlic until they become soft and fragrant, about 3 minutes.</li>
                <li>Combine Everything:
                Add the cooked beans to the pan with the onions and garlic. Stir well to combine. If it seems too dry, you can add a little of the reserved bean cooking liquid.
                Return the bacon and sausage to the pan. Mix everything together.</li>
                <li>Cook the Eggs:
                In a separate pan, scramble the eggs until just cooked, then add them to the beans, stirring gently.</li>
                <li>Add the Manioc Flour:
                Sprinkle the manioc flour (farinha de mandioca) over the mixture, stirring until everything is well coated. The flour will absorb the liquid and create a slightly crumbly texture. Add a bit more flour if you like a thicker consistency.</li>
                <li>Season:
                Taste and season with salt, black pepper, and smoked paprika (if using). Adjust the flavor to your preference.</li>
                <li>Serve:
                Garnish with chopped green onions or parsley. Serve the tropeiro beans with rice, or on its own as a complete meal.</li>
            </ol>
