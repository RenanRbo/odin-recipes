            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Here's a super simple Omelet recipe:</p>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
               <li>2 large eggs</li>
                <li>1 tbsp butter (or oil)</li>
                <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
                <li>Optional fillings (choose any or mix):</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Shredded cheese (cheddar, mozzarella, etc.)</li>
                        <li>Chopped veggies (tomato, bell pepper, spinach, onions)
                        <li>Cooked bacon or ham</li>
                        <li>Fresh herbs (parsley, chives, etc.)</li>
                    </ul>
            </ul>

                <h3>Steps</h3>

                <ol>
                    <li>Prep the eggs: Crack the eggs into a bowl, add a pinch of salt and pepper, and whisk them together until the yolks and whites are fully combined.</li>
                    <li>Heat the pan: Place a non-stick skillet or frying pan on medium heat and melt the butter (or heat the oil) until it's hot but not browning.</li>
                    <li>Cook the eggs: Pour the eggs into the pan, swirling it around to spread them evenly. Let them cook for about 1-2 minutes until the edges start to set.</li>
                    <li>Add fillings: Once the eggs start to set but the center is still slightly runny, sprinkle your fillings over half of the omelet.</li>
                    <li>Fold and finish: Using a spatula, gently fold the omelet in half over the fillings. Let it cook for another 30 seconds to 1 minute to melt the cheese and ensure everything is heated through.</li>
                    <li>Serve: Slide the omelet onto a plate and enjoy immediately!</li>
                </ol>
